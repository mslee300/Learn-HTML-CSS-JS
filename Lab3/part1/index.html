			<h2> Introduction to HTML </h2>
				<h3> What is HTML? </h3> 
				
				<p> HTML is a markup language to create websites, weblogs and
					 webpages. It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language </p> 
					 
				<p> There are different versions of HTML such as HTML 1.0, 
					HTML 2.0 etc. But the latest version of HTML is 
					<strong> HTML 5 </strong>.</p>
					
				<p> The following table includes some useful HTML tages. </p>
					
				<ol>
					<li> <em>p</em> for paragraph </li>
					<li> <em>h1</em> for top-level heading</li>
					<li> <em>h2</em> for second level heading </li>
					<li> <em>ol</em> for <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/
						tags/att_ol_start.asp">ordered list</a> </li>
					<li> <em>li</em> for list items </li>
				</ol>

				<h2>What Are Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)?</h2>

				<p>Before the invention of Cascading Style Sheets, HTML pages included
				   both content (words and images to be displayed) and style (fonts, font
			       sizes, font colors, background colors, borders, text alignment, etc.). 
				   But the options for controlling the appearance of the page were 
				   limited, and having content and style information together on the HTML
				   page made it hard to update pages, maintain consistent designs from 
				   page to page, and update the design of pages.</p>

				<p>Fortunately, a much better option for specifying style has replaced 
				   this: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). A Cascading Style Sheet, usually a 
				   separate file ending in ".css", contains rules for formatting various
				   HTML tags and other "selectors." HTML pages include one or more tags 
 				   within the element that specify which style sheet(s) the page is 
				   using.</p>

				<p>Separating formatting and content has several benefits:</p>

    			<ul>
					<li>It is easier to change a website's design, because formatting 
						information is all in one place.</li>
					<li>Multiple pages on a website can use the same style sheet, 
						resulting in visual consistency among related pages.</li>
					<li>It is easier for multiple people to collaborate; a designer can
					    edit the style sheet while a writer edits the HTML page.</li>
					<li>Different style sheets can be applied to the same content for 
						different purposes. For example, one might provide one stylesheet
					    that has high contrast and large fonts for visually impaired 
						users, and another style sheet with a simple layout more suitable
 					    for a mobile device.</li>
				</ul>
