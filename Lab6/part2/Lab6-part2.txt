	a. I included Monaco as my Mac-friendly font, Consolas as my PC-friendly font, and sans-serif as my generic font family.
	b. I used Bootstrap to make a 4 column layout in the main content area for large screen sizes. If the screen size decreases to a medium screen, the layout will be a 3 column layout. If the screen size decreases to a small screen, the layout will be a 2 column layout. For smaller sizes, the page will be a one column layout.
	c. h1 and header tags are suppressed by Media Queries.
