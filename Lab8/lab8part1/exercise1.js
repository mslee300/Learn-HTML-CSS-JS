//Exercise 1:
 
/* 
Variables:
   Fill in the parentheses to print out the sum of
   the variables a1, b1, c1, and d1, then look at 
   the console in your browser to check the result.
*/

let a1 = 1;  
let b1 = 2;  
let c1 = 3; 
let d1 = 4;

console.log(a1+b1+c1+d1);


/* 
Strings:
   We can combine strings together in Javascript
   using the + sign. Un-comment the following line 
   of code. Then complete it so that it prints out:
    
   					   Hello World!
   
   Check the output by looking at the console.
*/

console.log("Hello " + "World" + "!");


/* 
Parentheses:
   Order matters in Javascript. We can tell Javascript
   to do something first by placing parentheses around
   some code. First un-comment the following 3 lines 
   of code. Then, use parentheses to make the output 
   of the code print:
   
   						The sum is 42
   
   Check the output by looking at the console.
*/
    
let a2 = 11;
let b2 = 31;
console.log("The sum is " + (a2 + b2));
