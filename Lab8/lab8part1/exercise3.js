// Exercise 3: 
/* In this problem you will write 
   a simple JS program that computes the 
   integers 0 through 4 using expressions involving 
   exactly four fours and no other numbers. 
   Your expressions may use any of the following
   operators: +, -, *, / and parentheses. 
   Your expressions may not use anything else 
   except the above operators and the numeral 4.
*/

// For example:

let zero = 4 + 4 - 4 - 4
console.log(zero)

// look at the console to see numeral 0. 

/* Now, do the rest in the following lines. 
   You need to un-comment them step by step.
   after each step, look at the console 
   to check your answers.
*/

let one = (4 + 4 - 4) / 4
console.log(one)

let two = 4 * 4 / (4 + 4)
console.log(two)

let three = (4 + 4 + 4) / 4
console.log(three)

let four = 4 * (4 - 4) + 4
console.log(four)
